Called club house on 8/16/2019 to ask given that their website states that they are \"Opening This Summer\". Employee said they currently do not offer mountain biking, though he wished they did, and would look into updating their website. https://www.aftonalps.com/explore-th...ountain-biking Nate K, Thanks for the update. This post was caught in the filters - Probably because it was a new user posting a URL. I accidentally deleted your login while blowing away about 100 or so spammers. Sorry about that. Please retry when you get chance. I think you can continue to be Nate K, but you'll need to re-register.","lastUpdated":"2019-08-19T09:20"},{"name":"Battle Creek","status":"Dry","description":"FROM FACEBOOK: Happy Friday, everyone!

Just a quick heads up: Freight Train needs some touch up work before the weekend. Your tireless trail crew will be tackling it this evening. We need to close Freight Train to safely do the work.

Use the Hutchinson Rd parking lot, in order to stay solely on the dry trails. It's likely all of the trails will soon open, but please be patient and wait until the COGGS trail steward gives the word.","lastUpdated":"2017-05-10T11:36"},{"name":"Whitetail Ridge","status":"Tacky","description":"Hero dirt.
