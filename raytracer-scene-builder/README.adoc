= Scene Builder

Reads in a kotlin dsl that describes a scene and can either render it to an image using the JVM implementation
or output the scene to yaml that can be read in by the multiplatform projects to generate an image.

This is currently written for JVM only because there doesn't appear to be a way to load kotlin script files on
other platforms.

To run execute `run-scene-builder`. Use `run-scene-builder --help to see usage`

Check out `scenes` folder to see sample scene files.

== TODOs

- Better documentation
- More user friendly interface
- Possibly better name since this dosn't actually build a scene but rather works on a scene file
