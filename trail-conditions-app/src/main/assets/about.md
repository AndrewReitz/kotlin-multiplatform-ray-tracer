This app was created by [Andrew Reitz](http://andrewreitz.com). It works by
using the information from the
[MORC Trails Conditions Page](http://www.morcmtb.org/forums/trailconditions.php) which is
updated and maintained by volunteers.

**Please please please** don't ride on wet/muddy trails. If you see someone on them when
they aren't open please speak up, it's a community effort.

## Volunteers!

**Thanks so much** to all the people who keep the trails maintained, who help keep the websites and
anyone else who let us enjoy this great sport!

If you'd like to get involved please consider going to one of the trail maintenance nights,
or email to figure out another way to help out! Info about work nights and
contact information can all be found in the individual [trail pages](http://www.morcmtb.org/trail/)

## This App

If you find any issues/bugs, have any comments, ideas, or what to get involved. Feel free to
contact me at [andrewreitz@protonmail.com](mail://andrewreitz@protonmail.com).

I do this in my free time but still want to make the best app I can, so I'll try my best to
implement feature requests.
