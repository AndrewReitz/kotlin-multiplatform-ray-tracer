Sustainable trails are built so that water will run across the trail, not down it. When water
runs down the trail it focuses the water and increases erosion. Riding wet trails creates ruts
that will focus the water and increase erosion.

Riding wet trails also increases cupping of the trail surface and causes puddles to get deeper
and wider, both of which slow the recovery of the trail.

Trails are closed (and often fenced off) during the freeze/thaw cycle in the fall and spring.
During these times, trails are especially susceptible to significant damage.

Trails may also be closed after significant weather events, or if there are unsafe trail conditions.

The trails around the Twin Cities metro area are particularly sensitive due to the very large
numbers of users these trails get every year.

When trails turn into maintenance headaches, land managers start to consider closing trails
for good... PLEASE do your part to ensure that we have access to great trails by riding
responsibly. Together we can keep these mountain biking opportunities available for generations to come!

Wet Trail Conditions

Beyond major closures, knowing when not to ride after a rainfall can be less obvious. Trails
will not be posted as closed or fenced off after normal rainfalls/storms, so it is up to you
to make an educated decision. Here are some general rules regarding wet conditions:

- Trails should not be used during wet weather, or when the trail is soft or muddy.
- Trails are open if the trail is firm and the surface will not be disturbed by foot or bike travel.
- PLEASE be patient if the trail isn't ready... allow the trail to dry before riding.
- Trails are typically too wet to ride for 18-24 hours after a significant rainfall.
- Riding wet trails damages the trail by creating ruts that increase erosion.

Please check the Trail Conditions Pages above for the most up-to-date information. And if you ride
a trail, please take a minute and update the conditions if they haven't been updated in a
while... this is a great way to both help out your fellow riders and help preserve the trails we love!
