= Kotlin MultiPlatform RayTracer

A Ray Tracer written in Kotlin based on the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge"

The goal of this is to learn how to use Kotlin multiplatform, see the performance difference between the platforms
and learn more about performance optimizations for all platforms
(specifically around dividing work up using coroutines).

To run
```
gradlew run // jvm
gradlew jsNodeRun // node
gradlew runReleaseExecutableLinuxX64 // linux
gradlew runReleaseExecutableMacosX64 // mac
gradlew.bat runReleaseExecutableMingwX64 // windows
```

There is no reason other platforms couldn't be supported, I just haven't chosen to support / try them out. Should
be as simple as updating the `multiplatform-common.gradle.kts` file to include other platforms.

Outputs are in ppm which can be opened in GIMP or Preview (MacOS).
